This is my Game Frame and Library. It's written in Java.

Until now its supports the following:

- XBox Controller input for Windows. Mac is nearly done
- It's able to draw different 2D Sprites in different formats.
- There are different entity types like mobs or a player class

This will be my personal java game "framework" so i can create java games fast on this base.

Working ...
